从五道口到王子屯, 我是一个大概以为知道自己在干什么的博士生: 
专业量子, 爱好信息, 于是做点量子信息... 

有的时候随性惯了, 人就懒得想今后要干什么. 
总算现在还幸运地有些奢侈地可以慢慢来. 

A PhD student in Princeton, with undergrad in Tsinghua. 
I probably know what I am going to do: I major in Quantum physics 
and like Information tech, so I am on Quantum Information...

Being careless for too long, sometimes I am not willing to consider
too much about what shall happen in the future. However, 
it's a great fortune to have the luxury free choice to wondering
around what I am curious about.
